🎵 Jewish Music Preview Ultra
Jewish Music Preview Ultra is a high-performance, single-page web application designed to streamline the discovery of Jewish music. By utilizing 30-second high-quality previews, the platform allows users to quickly "capture the vibe" of a track without having to listen to full songs or manually skip through irrelevant content.

🎯 Our Goal
The primary objective of this project is to eliminate "search fatigue." Instead of spending time skipping through full tracks to find something you enjoy, this app presents the most essential part of the song immediately. This makes it easier to curate your personal library and discover new artists in a fraction of the time.

✨ Key Features
Dual-Layer Filtering Engine: Features an Admin Dashboard to manage Whitelists (approved artists) and Blacklists (blocked keywords) to maintain a focused experience.

Dynamic UI Scaling: Includes a unique "App Scale" system to optimize the layout for everything from small monitors to large-scale TV/Cinema displays.

Audio Visualization: A real-time frequency analyzer provides a visual representation of the music during playback.

Theater Mode: Dim the entire interface to focus purely on the album art and the music.

Sleep Timer: Built-in countdown functionality to automatically stop music after a set duration.

🚀 Getting Started
Initial Setup: When you first launch the app, you will be prompted to select a Startup Scale. Choose the one that best fits your screen size.

Accessing Admin Features: * Click the Settings icon.

Click the Admin button.

Enter the default PIN (found in the source code under admin.pin) to access Whitelist, Blacklist, and User Report management.

Building your Library: Use the search bar to find artists. Click the "Star" icon to save songs to your local library for quick access later.

⚠️ Important Disclosures & Legal
1. Content Filtering Disclaimer
While this application includes a filtering engine designed to promote "Kosher" and Jewish music, no automated or manual filter is 100% perfect.

Because the app pulls from a global database (iTunes), non-Jewish or "non-kosher" music may occasionally appear in search results due to metadata overlaps or broad search terms.

The developers and maintainers are not responsible for any content that bypasses the filter or for the nature of the music retrieved by the API.

Users are encouraged to use the built-in Report feature to flag inappropriate content for administrative review.

2. Security Disclosure (PIN Bypass)
Please Note: This application is a client-side prototype. The Admin PIN and filtering logic are stored in the frontend code. As a result, the PIN is easily bypassable by users with basic technical knowledge (e.g., using Browser Developer Tools). This tool is intended for personal use or environments where a "soft" filter is sufficient, rather than a strictly enforced security environment.

3. Copyright and Intellectual Property
This application does not host any music files. All audio previews and album artworks are served directly from Apple’s iTunes API.

All rights to the music, lyrics, and imagery belong to their respective artists and record labels.

The 30-second previews are provided for discovery purposes only, in accordance with the API's terms of service.

4. Limitation of Liability
By using this application, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk. The creators shall not be held liable for any content displayed, any data loss in localStorage, or any issues arising from external links to third-party platforms like YouTube or Spotify.
